# System Design Must Read <WIP - Work in Progress>

Here I am trying to consolidate curated list of resources and links which I followed to get through Google L6. 

I believe that these will not just help you to clear interviews for companies like Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, UBER etc at senior or staff roles. They will also make you better software engineer and you can apply this knowledge in your day to day work.
